  <p>R7X districts are also governed by contextual <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#quality" class="glossary">Quality Housing</a> bulk
    regulations but the substantially higher <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#floor" class="glossary">floor area ratio</a> (FAR)
    and maximum building height typically produce taller, bulkier buildings than in R7A and R7B districts. The
    flexibility of the R7X regulations is exemplified by the 12- to 14-story apartment buildings in the R7X districts
    mapped along major thoroughfares in Harlem in Manhattan and Jackson Avenue in Long Island City in Queens.</p>
  <p>The FAR in R7X districts is 5.0. Above a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#base_height" class="glossary">base height</a> of 60
    to 85 feet, the building must be set back a depth of 10 feet on a <a target="_blank"

    feet on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#narrow"
      class="glossary">narrow street</a> before rising to its maximum height of 120 feet. If providing a qualifying
    ground floor, the maximum base height is 95 feet and the maximum height of the building is 125 feet. To maintain the
    traditional streetscape, the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#streetwall" class="glossary">street wall</a> of a new
    building can be no closer to the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_line_zoning" class="glossary">street line</a>
    than any adjacent street wall but need not be farther than 10 feet. The building must have interior amenities for
    residents pursuant to the Quality Housing Program.</p>
  <p>Higher maximum FAR and heights are available for buildings participating in the in<a target="_blank"

      Program</a> or that provide certain senior facilities.</p>
  <p>Off-street parking is generally required for 50 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower
    for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#income_restricted_housing_unit"
      class="glossary">income-restricted housing units</a> (IRHU) and are further modified in certain areas, such as

    or for lots 10,000 square feet or less. Off-street parking requirements can be waived if 15 or fewer parking spaces
    are required.</p>
