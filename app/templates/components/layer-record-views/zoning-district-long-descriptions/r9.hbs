  <h4>R9 Height Factor/Tower Regulations</h4>
  <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#floor" class="glossary">floor
      area ratio</a> (FAR) for height ­factor/tower buildings ranges from 0.99 to 7.52 and the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#open_space_ratio" class="glossary">open space
      ratio</a> (OSR) from 1.0 to 9.0. As in other height factor districts, a taller building can usually be developed
    by providing more open space. Under the tower rules, however, buildings on both wide and narrow streets are
    permitted to penetrate the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#sky_exposure_plane" class="glossary">sky exposure
      plane</a>. In the diagram, for example, buildings that front on a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#wide_street" class="glossary">wide street</a> must
    have a contextual street wall of 60 to 85 feet with a tower above (<a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#tower_on_a_base"
      class="glossary">tower-on-a-base</a>). The height of the tower is controlled by a minimum <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_coverage" class="glossary">lot coverage</a>
    requirement and a rule that at least 55% of the floor area on the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_or_zoning_lot" class="glossary">zoning lot</a> be
    located below a height of 150 feet. For buildings with only <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#narrow" class="glossary">narrow street</a> frontage,
    a contextual base is not required and towers are permitted, provided they are set back from the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_line_zoning" class="glossary">street line</a> at
    least 15 feet.</p>

      Program</a> or that provide certain senior facilities.</p>
  <p>Off-street parking is generally required for 40 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower
    for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#income_restricted_housing_unit"
      class="glossary">income-restricted housing units</a> (IRHU) and are further modified in certain areas, such as

    or for lots less than 15,000 square feet. Off-street parking requirements can be waived if 15 or fewer parking
    spaces are required or if the zoning lot is 10,000 square feet or less.</p>
