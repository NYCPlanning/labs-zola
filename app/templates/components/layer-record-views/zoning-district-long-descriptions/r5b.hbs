      class="glossary">semi-detached</a> buildings, it is primarily a three-story rowhouse district typical of such
    neighborhoods as Windsor Terrace and Bay Ridge in Brooklyn. The traditional quality of R5B districts is reflected in
    the district’s height and <a target="_blank"

  <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#floor" class="glossary">floor
      area ratio</a> (FAR) of 1.35 typically produces a building with a maximum <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#streetwall" class="glossary">street wall</a> height
    of 30 feet, above which the building slopes or is set back to a maximum height of 33 feet. As in R4B districts, the
    front yard must be at least five feet deep and it must be at least as deep as one adjacent front yard and no deeper
    than the other, but it need not exceed a depth of 20 feet. Attached rowhouses do not require side yards but there
    must be at least eight feet between the end buildings in a row and buildings on adjacent zoning lots. Curb cuts are
    prohibited on zoning lot frontages less than 40 feet. Where off-street parking is required, on-site spaces must be
    provided for two-thirds of the dwelling units although parking can be waived when only one space is required.
