  <p>Created to accommodate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#tower"
      class="glossary">towers</a> facing elevated rail lines, R9D districts produce tall buildings set back from the <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_line_zoning"
      class="glossary">street line</a> to minimize train noise for occupants of the buildings and maximize light and air
    for pedestrians at street level. Portions of the River Avenue corridor around 161st Street in the Bronx are mapped
    C6-3D which has an R9D <a target="_blank"

      class="glossary">residential district equivalent</a>.</p>
  <p>The tower portion of the building must be set back at least 20 feet from the street line when facing an elevated
    rail line. In C6-3D districts, the tower must rise above a low base set at the street line that is between 0 and 25
    feet high. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#setback_building"
      class="glossary">setback</a> is not required when a building wall is within 70 feet of a street intersection.</p>
  <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#floor" class="glossary">floor
      area ratio</a> (FAR) is 9.0. There is no maximum building height in an R9D district but special rules control the
    width of towers and ensure articulated tower tops for the highest four stories or that portion of the building above
    165 feet, whichever is less.</p>

  <p>Off-street parking is generally required for 40 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower

    spaces are required or if the zoning lot is 10,000 square feet or less.</p>
