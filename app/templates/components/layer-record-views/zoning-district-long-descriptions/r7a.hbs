  <p>The contextual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#quality"
      class="glossary">Quality Housing</a> regulations, which are mandatory in R7A districts, typically produce high <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_coverage" class="glossary">lot
      coverage</a>, seven- to nine- -story apartment buildings, blending with existing buildings in many established
    neighborhoods. R7A districts are mapped along Prospect Park South and Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, Jackson Heights in
    Queens, and in Harlem and along the avenues in the East Village in Manhattan.</p>
  <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#floor" class="glossary">floor
      area ratio</a> (FAR) in R7A districts is 4.0. Above a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#base_height" class="glossary">base height</a> of 40
    to 65 feet, or 75 feet if providing a qualifying ground floor, the building must set back to a depth of 10 feet on a

      street</a> and 15 feet on a<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#narrow"
      class="glossary"> narrow street</a> before rising to a maximum height of 80 feet, or 85 feet if providing a
    qualifying ground floor. In order to preserve the traditional streetscape, the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#streetwall" class="glossary">street wall</a> of a new
    building can be no closer to the street line, than any adjacent street wall, but need not be farther than 10 feet.
    Buildings must have interior amenities for the residents pursuant to the Quality Housing Program. Off-street parking
    is not allowed in front of a building.</p>
  <p>Off-street parking is generally required for 50 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower
    for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#income_restricted_housing_unit"
      class="glossary">income-restricted housing units</a> (IRHU) and are further modified in certain areas, such as
    within the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#transit_zone"

    or for lots 10,000 square feet or less. Off-street parking requirements can be waived if 15 or fewer parking spaces
    are required.</p>
  <p>Higher maximum FAR and heights are available for buildings participating in the <a target="_blank"
