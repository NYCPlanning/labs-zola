  <p>R8X contextual districts are governed by <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#quality" class="glossary">Quality Housing</a> bulk
    regulations. R8X districts are similar to R8A districts but permit a higher building height that typically produces
    15- to 17-story apartment buildings that replicate the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#building_envelope" class="glossary">building
      envelope</a> of the older, traditional buildings in Prospect Heights and Park Slope that surround Grand Army
    Plaza.</p>
  <p>The floor area ratio (FAR) in R8X districts is 6.02. Above a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#base_height" class="glossary">base height</a> of 60
    to 85 feet, the building must set back to a depth of 10 feet on a <a target="_blank"

    feet on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#narrow"
      class="glossary">narrow street</a> before rising to a maximum building height of 150 feet. If providing a
    qualifying ground floor, the maximum base height is 95 feet, and the maximum height is 155 feet. As in R8A
    districts, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#streetwall"
      class="glossary">street wall</a> on a wide street must extend along the entire width of the zoning lot and at
    least 70% of the street wall must be within eight feet of the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_line_zoning" class="glossary">street line</a>.
    Buildings must have interior amenities for residents pursuant to the Quality Housing Program.</p>
  <p>Higher maximum FAR and heights are available for buildings participating in the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#inclusionary" class="glossary"> Inclusionary Housing
      Program</a> or that provide certain senior facilities.</p>
  <p>Off-street parking is generally required for 40 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower
    for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#income_restricted_housing_unit"
      class="glossary">income-restricted housing units</a> (IRHU) and are further modified in certain areas, such as
    within the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#transit_zone"

      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#manhattan_core" class="glossary">Manhattan Core</a>,
    or for lots less than 15,000 square feet. Off-street parking requirements can be waived if 15 or fewer parking
    spaces are required or if the zoning lot is 10,000 square feet or less. Off-street parking is not allowed in front
    of a building.</p>
