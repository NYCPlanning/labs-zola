  <p>&nbsp;The contextual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#quality"
      class="glossary">Quality Housing</a> bulk regulations, which are mandatory in R8A districts, typically result in
    high <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_coverage"
      class="glossary">lot coverage</a> apartment buildings of roughly 12 to 14 stories, set at or near the <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_line_zoning"
      class="glossary">street line</a>. Limitations on the base height and maximum building height of new buildings
    ensure compatibility with existing buildings on the street. Parts of DUMBO in Brooklyn and West Chelsea in Manhattan
    are R8A districts.</p>
  <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#floor" class="glossary">floor
      area ratio</a> (FAR) in R8A districts is 6.02. Above a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#base_height" class="glossary">base height</a> of 60
    to 85 feet, the building must set back to a depth of 10 feet on a <a target="_blank"

    feet on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#narrow"
      class="glossary">narrow street</a> before rising to its maximum height of 120 feet. If providing a <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#qualifying_ground_floor"
      class="glossary">qualifying ground floor</a>, the maximum base height is 95 feet, and the maximum height is 125
    feet. On a wide street, the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#streetwall" class="glossary">street wall</a> must
    extend along the entire width of the zoning lot and at least 70% of the street wall must be within eight feet of the
    street line. The area between a building’s street wall and the street line must be planted and the building must
    have interior amenities pursuant to the Quality Housing Program.</p>
  <p>Higher maximum FAR and heights are available for buildings participating in the<a target="_blank"

      Program</a> or that provide certain senior facilities.</p>
  <p>Off-street parking is generally required for 40 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower

      class="glossary">income-restricted housing units</a> (IRHU) and are further modified in certain areas, such as

    or for lots less than 15,000 square feet. Off-street parking requirements can be waived if 15 or fewer parking
    spaces are required or if the zoning lot is 10,000 square feet or less. Off-street parking is not allowed in front
    of a building.</p>
