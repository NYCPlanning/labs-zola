  <p>R6B districts are often traditional row house districts, which preserve the scale and harmonious streetscape of
    neighborhoods of four-story attached buildings developed during the 19th century. Many of these houses are set back
    from the street with stoops and small front yards that are typical of Brooklyn’s “brownstone” neighborhoods, such as
    Park Slope, Boerum Hill and Bedford Stuyvesant.</p>
  <p>The Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 2.0 and the mandatory <a target="_blank"

    be between 30 and 40 feet and the maximum height is 50 feet. For buildings providing a qualifying ground floor, the

    building, on any lot up to 50 feet wide, must be as deep as one adjacent street wall but no deeper than the other.
    Buildings must have interior amenities for the residents pursuant to the Quality Housing Program.</p>

    certain senior facilities.</p>
  <p>Off-street parking is generally required for 50 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower
