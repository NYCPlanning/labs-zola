  <p>Apartment buildings in R8 districts can range from mid-rise, eight- to ten-story buildings to much taller buildings
    set back from the street on large zoning lots. This high density residential district is mapped along the Grand
    Concourse in the Bronx and on the edge of Brooklyn Heights. R8 districts are also widely mapped in Manhattan
    neighborhoods, such as Washington Heights. New buildings in R8 districts may be developed under either <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#height_factor"
      class="glossary">height factor</a> regulations or the optional <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#quality" class="glossary">Quality Housing</a>
    regulations that often reflect the older, pre-1961 neighborhood streetscape.</p>

  <h4>Height Factor Regulations</h4>
  <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#floor" class="glossary">floor
      area ratio</a>(FAR) for height factor development in R8 districts ranges from 0.94 to 6.02; the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#open_space_ratio" class="glossary">open space
      ratio</a> (OSR) ranges from 5.9 to 11.9. A taller building may be obtained by providing more open space. In the
    diagram, for example, 64% of the zoning lot with the 17-story building must be open space (6.02 FAR x 10.7 OSR).
    Thus, the maximum FAR is achievable only where the zoning lot is large enough to accommodate a practical building
    footprint as well as the required amount of open space. There are no absolute height limits; the building must be
    set within a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#sky_exposure_plane"
      class="glossary">sky exposure plane</a> which, in R8 districts, begins at a height of 85 feet above the <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_line_zoning"
      class="glossary">street line</a> and then slopes inward over the zoning lot.</p>
  <p>Off-street parking is generally required for 40 percent of a building’s dwelling units, but requirements are lower
    for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#income_restricted_housing_unit"
      class="glossary">income-restricted housing units</a> (IRHU) and are further modified in certain areas, such as
    within the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#transit_zone"
      class="glossary">Transit Zone</a> and the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#manhattan_core" class="glossary">Manhattan Core</a>,
    or for lots less than 15,000 square feet. Off-street parking requirements can be waived if 15 or fewer parking
    spaces are required or if the zoning lot is 10,000 square feet or less.</p>

  <h4>Quality Housing Regulations</h4>
  <p>The optional Quality Housing regulations in R8 districts utilize height limits to produce lower, high <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#lot_coverage" class="glossary">lot
      coverage</a> buildings set at or near the street line. With floor area ratio (FAR) equal to or greater than can be
    achieved using R8 height factor regulations, the optional Quality Housing regulations produce new buildings in
    keeping with many of the city’s established neighborhoods.</p>
  <p>The maximum FAR on narrow streets is 6.02, and the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#base_height" class="glossary">base height</a> before
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#setback_building"
      class="glossary">setback</a> is 60 to 85 feet with a maximum building height of 115 feet. On <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#wide_street" class="glossary">wide streets</a>
    outside the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#manhattan_core"
      class="glossary">Manhattan Core</a>, the FAR rises to 7.2, and the base height before setback is 60 to 95 feet
    with a maximum building height of 130 feet, or 135 feet if providing a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#qualifying_ground_floor" class="glossary">qualifying
      ground floor</a>. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#streetwall"
      class="glossary">street wall</a> of the building must extend along the width of the zoning lot and at least 70% of
    the street wall must be within eight feet of the street line.</p>
  <p>Higher maximum FAR and heights are available for buildings participating in the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#inclusionary" class="glossary">Inclusionary Housing
      Program</a> or that provide certain senior facilities.</p>
  <p>The area between a building’s street wall and the street line must be planted and the building must have interior
    amenities for residents pursuant to the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page#quality" class="glossary">Quality Housing
      Program</a>.</p>
  <p>Off-street parking requirements are the same as for height factor buildings.</p>
